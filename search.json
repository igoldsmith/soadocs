Depending app, might need use encoding byte value. use UTF-8 encoding. Below example using Java. Note: example above part larger Java sample specific API. more information, refer implementation examples API you're using.

Make sure agreement between key players before development starts. Separate functional non-functional requirements develop functional requirements. Iterate through API development process. Utilize existing SOA investment. Defining API Requirements Defining API does separated API does point, defining functional characteristics API, specifying interface, developing model use cases user stories. Implementation details purposely deferred until later. several artifacts help refine requirements. include: Use case models show relationship between actors use cases. Use cases describe scenario--the interaction between API user--as expected result. User stories small narrative descriptions describe specific interaction between API user system. soa.com Not every requirement need described detail, team might choose slightly modify artifacts use define requirement. However, set described provides best practices approach elaborating requirement. might find choose approach. right organization really depends organizational culture. Use Cases Use Case Models tend more prescriptive detailed, whereas User Stories more compact lend themselves better iterative approach. Whatever method methods choose, important thing explain requirements clearly, sufficient detail, API design development proceed smoothly successful completion. Use case models, use cases, user stories help illustrate requirements very practical realistic way, invaluable helping keep project focused real-world user needs. Identify API Used way API used affects several issues such technology choices, regulatory issues, security. example, API that's being used perform financial transactions more constraints delivering advertisements. ways API might used include: mobile application Delivery banner ads Web page part mashup Servicing financial transactions Providing self-serve portal Enabling connection new business existing enterprise soa.com API Usage Patterns users API help determine technology issues may determine content each development phase API being delivered. Consumers API include: Internal consumers External unregistered users External registered users Business partners general best plan least controlled set users identifying API function content. example, API intended internal users, chance future API made available business partners customers, designers focus external users determining API function content. may good idea develop API initially internal consumption before making available externally, design not factor external requirements future releases. Internal deployment may help identify new requirements added list possible features future development phases. allows API provider gain experience design before making public. important API provided external users, signals long-term commitment API, implies API stable. Regulatory Issues Almost any business activity affected form regulatory activity. business decides provide API consumers, probably requirement type regulatory compliance. activity business domain expert must identify applicable guidelines make sure included requirements list first release. usually easier product owner plan types issues earlier development phases retrofit requirement. Examples regulations might affect API development USA include PCI DSS payment card data security standard, HIPAA governs privacy healthcare information, FERPA Family Education Rights Privacy act). many others USA, each country its unique regulations. Key factors consider industry API deployed deployment areas. soa.com Usage, Content Functionality Constraints Not enterprises happy \"showing family jewels\" part API successful, must offer value those use must seen valuable, core part enterprise offering not likely case senior management unhappy risk being created exposure content functionality worried undesirable use API. It's important think through, discuss, agreement constrained API, phasing relaxing those constraints any). soa.com Leveraging SOA Investment organization through expense, trials, effort creating successful SOA infrastructure, makes sense leverage investment. design constraints modern API similar not identical those Services SOA. Design API different short cuts. However, organization successful SOA build API becomes largely exercise mapping rather fully blown coding. Separating Functional Non-Functional Requirements Not requirements functional nature: availability, scalability, logging, security, performance critical successful use API, none anything business process domain API's resource. information gathered during phase may understood before project begins. However, documenting non-functional requirements might identify new requirements not originally considered must added project backlog. affect cost viability project. Lastly, most Services SOA rendered non-reusable non-functional incompatibilities. certainly true APIs. example, fact particular security mechanism assumed hard-coded service, consumers required different security mechanism, means service/API not reusable. true any non-functional capability, including logging fail-over. two big differences between functional non-functional requirements: Non-functional requirements more variable functional requirements. Implementing non-functional requirements declarative policies quicker easier implementing functional requirements. differences between it's important separate two types requirements. soa.com Defining API Specification Once you've worked through points chapter, strategic groundwork done. Once you've identified mapped business strategy APIs, really API requirements, it's time put together API Specification. specification adds detail needed sensibly understand API intended its importance respect business strategy. Designing API APIs lightweight, self-describing, agile interfaces lend themselves easy access re-use. not SOA Services another name. must keep mind designing building APIs. being said, process designing developing APIs comparable required any software development projects, although notable differences spelled remainder section.

OAuth takes lessons learned XACML SAML SOA world applies problem exists current crop Web Security practices. current security solutions assume two actors, consumer provider. traditional client-server authentication model, client uses its credentials access its resources hosted server. OAuth introduces third role model: resource owner. OAuth model, client not resource owner, acting its behalf) requests access resources controlled resource owner, hosted server. order client access resources, first obtain permission resource owner. permission expressed form token matching shared secret. purpose token make unnecessary resource owner share its credentials client. Unlike resource owner credentials, tokens issued restricted scope limited lifetime revoked independently.

Not does require exposing user passwords someone else often same passwords used online banking sites provides applications unlimited access. anything, including changing passwords locking users OAuth provides method users grant third-party access resources without sharing passwords. provides way grant limited access scope, duration, etc.). example, Facebook user give another app access, via OAuth, contacts list without allowing app create posts. three OAuth versions; newly released most common implementation fixed security vulnerability OAuth although being newly released having simpler handshaking protocol better support JavaScript, may become more common version implemented short period time. looking platform implements OAuth support API's make sure supports least delivery date support soa.com Protecting Data Detecting Threats APIs use Web technologies open Internet, API developer encounter security threats commonplace ecosystem. Security non-trivial issue APIs, especially considering expose internal systems unknown outsider users. Consider following API security risks, determine steps might need take threat prevention, detection, handling: Malicious Code Injection manipulates security design flaws technologies send valid code services using SQL, LDAP, XPATH, XQuery statements open interface any user take control cause harm. Denial Service (DoS) Attacks -cripples API overwhelming requests \"Request Burst\"). Service Information LeakageAn API inadvertently leaking data its configuration, resulting ability take control expose private data. Broken Session IDs, Keys Authentication- Exposure unauthorized access through authentication factors not functioning poor security design technology bugs.

Tampering API Requests Responses- attack manipulates API request response parameters exchanged between client services goal modification data. Example \"Man Middle\" type attacks. Manage API Quality Service (QoS) OAuth enables enterprise resolve use API. However, many times use Excessive API use more damaging costly API provider use another side discussion. Good, well-built designed APIs monetized. monetization not countenanced management, nor accepted API users, unless SLA agreements managed, automatically, API. best way easily definable, modifiable, actionable QoS policies based reliable metrics. soa.com First, look API provider. API interface, door organization's business, defined allowed organization. representative any organization allowed implement critical business system without ability monitor control critical factors such accessing usage levels, performance. Therefore, doesn't make sense implement API, exposes critical business capability Internet, without similar controls place. Conversely, API consumer not likely use API don't guarantee availability performance API, since interruptions service adversely affect consumer's ability deliver its own business services, whether monetary technical. best practice addressing issues define manage service level agreements (SLAs) through contracts standards-based declarative. agreements place, API manager define absolute performance availability constraints API, specify such alerts issued constraints violated. Over-use treated throttling, while under-capacity treated dynamic provisioning additional capacity needed. Thus, organization its department assured API not perform any worse expected, not consume any resource expected. API consumer guaranteed availability performance requires, whether paying guarantee not, addition, consumer guarantees not require, use, anything more established. Please note any guarantee leads SLAs Quota policies must backed legally enforceable agreements between consumer entity enterprise, otherwise just defining policies monitoring purposes process defining contract between App API summarized follows: Determine absolute maximum capabilities API (max supportable throughput, response time, availability, etc.) Define SLA policy API warns criteria, alerts between depending criteria. soa.com Analyze SOA Services support API systems, not SOA infrastructure) apply SLA policies services match SLAs defined API.

Rather services already exist organization's SOA backend systems organization not yet created its SOA). case, defining SLA policies managing services using critical managing API itself, reason fact something causing SLA transgression next step root-cause analysis services supporting API anyway. Having process place, utilizes Plans Contracts, allows simpler consideration charging App owner based agreed Plan. Monitoring API Usage not possible implement ability manage API's quality service (QoS) without ability monitor activities usage API. API management solution enable monitor performance availability API its consumers. best practice monitor aspects usage API, such most popular consumers, most popular operation, operation consumption per consumer. Analytics running API very useful planning extensions API, understanding actual popularity money making ability API comparison projected. soa.com Furthermore, API involved financial transactions, might required make API metrics part audit process. Law compliance policies require adhere specific security practices. responses enable detection unauthorized users. Lastly, root cause analysis heavily relies logging means providing window actions API time error. Without deep, easily variable, logging capability, API issue resolution become horribly hitand-miss activity. API monitoring must meet needs three key roles: App Developer/provider API Developer API Operations staff First, App developer need ability requests responses API look treated API. ability able gauge app's impact API via common usage performance metrics. not same formalized SLAs mentioned previous section, metrics help determine SLA conformance. Second, API developer need logging help debug code while building API, need able metrics API performance during stress testing. Lastly, once API production, operations personnel need logging help root cause analysis any usage issues might arise, need monitor metrics app usage API's performance relation app. instance, might need provide auditors verifiable logs API requests soa.com Sharing API Once you've put hard work investment resources creation production API, equally hard work sharing popularizing begins. Supporting App developer community critical factor successful adoption API. App developers drawn API obvious being supported API provider colleagues. Without vibrant satisfied developer community, API unlikely used wide audience. Ensuring profitable engagement developers involves such considerations interactive forums, excellent documentation, ability test against API, Software Development Kit (SDK) makes easier deliver API external developers. best practices supporting API once it's released: Interact recognize API Developers. Create SDKs make life easier API Developers. Create great documentation API use Make testing against API easy possible. Monetize API assist future cost benefit analysis. Interact Recognize Developers Developers typically communicate developers. App Developers particular may work geographically dispersed teams still share thoughts ideas. API provider provide environment makes easy. API management tool include following features help give developers information interaction need: FAQ: frequently asked question section easily quickly solve many questions new developer good FAQ expected greatly enhance initial developer experience. Blogs: Provide blog chief technical designers discuss options, opinions, possible enhancements API. Developers know API may evolving. several good examples soa.com used model. example, good place share implementation tips, information upcoming releases. issues API, developers appreciate being notified pitfalls ideally, workarounds. Forums: perhaps most valuable communication tools available. allows developers share problems, solutions, suggestions each forums constantly monitored API provider proper content, most cases API provider not major participant. medium developers. Access API developers: Providing way key external developers communicate directly API development team very effective. needs controlled prevent overloading internal team; however, providing e-mail address appropriate privacy measure implemented, course) external developers ask specific questions make suggestions another way foster community developers. developers likely thrive efforts recognized. best champion API happy, informed knowledgeable developer constantly using community help App Developers. ways recognize developers include: Monetary: Establish monetary incentives higher levels adoption usage API. Peer Recognition: Establish superstar criteria feature outstanding developers shown new innovative ways use API. Peer recognition developer community strong incentive. Involvement API design strategy: developer invited help work through future API, bring unique insight API owner. developer reverently treated App Developer community, more powerful advocate use API. soa.com Create SDKs Making easy possible App developers use API may necessitate creation software development kit (SDK).For instance, platforms/devices support OAuth REST JSON not simple others. Consider following reasons might build SDK: Speed adoption specific platform example, Objective-C SDK iPhone. Lots experienced developers just starting Objective-C, SDK might helpful. Simplify integration effort required work API key use cases complex need complemented standard on-client processing. Reduce bad inefficient code might slow down service everyone. Create developer resource Good SDKs help users write good code providing good source code examples. Market API specific community upload SDK samples plug-in page platform's existing developer community. Foster adoption across devices--you might produce APIs currently popular platforms; providing corresponding SDKs each device help encourage developers across boards use API. said, may not provide SDK. example, API designed adoption, well-documented built using standards-based approach, developers may able rolling without client SDK. Below reasons might decide against providing SDK: Resources it's tough provide SDK each platform target. You'll choose carefully. time-consuming expensive create SDKs. (Tip: Packaging internal samples test cycles provide good starting point SDK development.) Maintenance versioning convincing clients upgrade newest version rough. capturing \"local flavor\" each language support challenge. Complexity each platform might use cases don't expect, such keeping application-level secrets clients, debugging, forth. soa.com More not necessarily better few well-documented code-level samples often best resource. Facebook provides Android, iPhone, JavaScript, PHP, Python libraries documented differently), Twitter supplies none. Facebook more resources still difficult, times, understand use Facebook APIs. worth acknowledging delivering SDKs big job building API. discussed earlier, job not done just building API. \"Field Dreams\" API economy, building API half job. Getting App developers excited API telling others great documentation SDKs ultimately make fantastic API successful. Document API You're need well-written documentation successful sharing API. Though live interaction may better way communication, there's just substitute non-ambiguous documentation explaining complex critical notions. Ideally, documentation quality small O'Reilly textbook IBM Redbook. Anything else not used may detract use API. Best practices suggest delivery documentation via HTML, not Word PDF. HTML documents may served organization's document content management systems, HTML best means delivery. Why? content searchable, especially people seeking information via Google, Bing, any Internet searching mechanism. acts marketing tool, letting prospective API developers know great API Another benefit online documentation immediately updated, users always referring latest greatest version. Make Testing Against API Easy Everybody dislikes testing (except those make living However, testing critical factor any software development cycle. applies API, applies equally apps use API. Untested poorly tested API consumers wreak havoc API ecosystem. Not organization suffer costly support, \"traditional\" systems, App soa.com Developers users impacted. Providing means making testing easier App developers must. Remember, significant number Gen not anything don't need more compelling way. Provide Allow API Interaction Test Console gives user ability define API call result. just important testing debugging output App development understanding API does. Nothing more attractive developer able something easily immediate result. API consumer large \"dev shop\" business partner, being able embed functionality own ecosystem more striking attraction. Utilize Sandbox Unlike many development activities organization, API development involves parties not part single organizational entity. means creating number replicated environments different data not practical. sandbox provides means testing against sample data without creating another instance API. sandbox simplifies management, hence cost, API provider. More importantly, gives App developer Internet-accessible place test functionality App. Once Developer considers App ready use, ready Production, use Sandbox acceptance testing. Moving App Production simple promotion process API Platform. actual configuration code movement necessary, far API concerned, production API definition already exists. It's just App authorized access Production URLs API. Monetizing API Very few internal initiatives make money. Fewer still built purpose mind. However, best practice APIs exactly contrast SOA, make money through internal charges theory rarely practice, API monetization actually works. It's cultural, not technical, issue. parties involved creating using service part culture work paid entity result used charge any part organization. traditional perspective, idea selling soa.com access API might against grain existing culture. not case APIs. API Economy, Apps considered commercial quantity. data consume. organizations, such Netflix, valued based capability APIs. Not every organization build APIs make money. However, once successful API built, App developers invariably following: Enter business agreement use API offers ability make money App developer realized, API provider organization just not imagine. Use API make money scenario API being monetized way new business opportunity. scenario API monetized way selling access API App Developer. both scenarios, notion using API free just not entertained. Culturally, just does not happen. enterprise builds best practice API consider monetizing API its newly evolving business model, reason makes future cost benefit analysis easier more accurate. soa.com SOA Software SOA Software leading provider Enterprise API Management SOA governance products enable customers plan, build, run share enterprise services APIs. world's largest companies including Bank America, fizer, Verizon use SOA Software products harness power technology transform businesses.

It's important set authentication messages app sends API you’re using. Authentication protects sender, receiver, message itself. It’s important security strong enough third party couldn’t pose sender, pose receiver, and/or view change message content. Authentication security particularly important money sensitive personally identifiable information involved. Once app registered, it's important set authentication app use API process messages securely. Community Platform, part setting app, you’ll need choose security mechanism you’ll use authentication messages. two choices: Note: topic provides information setting authentication any API hosted Community Platform. implementation information examples specific API you're using, refer documentation API. Both approaches very secure. Both use secret key combined hashing encoding, both sent via HTTPS. Shared Secret approach, default, easier implement since don't generate public private keys. PKI approach little more secure, although both approaches very secure. PKI approach more complex implement. Back top register app, AppID Shared Secret automatically generated. Shared Secret binary hashed value, generated secure environment Community Platformand known Community Platform. Security Credentials section app homepage you'll Shared Secret option default security mechanism. Shared Secret approach follows WS-Security digest authentication mechanism. Shared Secret, generated Community Platform, 40-character alphanumeric value acts key. example shown below. combine Shared Secret two values, hash result using SHA-1 secure hashing algorithm, encode hashed value using Base64 encoding scheme. URL-encode result, isn't required. result sent Authorization message header value atmosphere_secret_digest parameter. API verifies each incoming request using Shared Secret. choose Shared Secret security mechanism, Authorization header must include values shown below. More information shared secret approach given sections: process flow diagram below shows overview API request authentication shared secret security mechanism. Below example Authorization header app authentication parameters, use shared secret approach. sequence parameters isn't significant, parameters must present valid values. Note: value Community Platform realm determined www-Authenticate header. Make sure value set Authorization: Community Platform header matches value received attribute server. nonce random string uniquely generated each request. nonce allows API providers verify request never made before. nonce sent message header both Shared Secret PKI security mechanisms. Shared Secret mechanism, same nonce value sent message header used creating Community Platform Secret Digest. way create nonce depend development environment. Most programming languages include method creating nonce. Below example generating nonce value Java: timestamp request sent message header, both Shared Secret PKI security mechanisms. Shared Secret mechanism used creating Community Platform Secret Digest. timestamp must Unix epoch time, expressed number milliseconds since January GMT. timestamp must positive integer must greater equal timestamp used previous requests. most implementations, timestamp taken host server. It's important timestamp message accurate; timestamp message might rejected. more information Unix epoch time, examples implementation timestamp different programming languages, http://www.epochconverter.com (scroll down). SHA-1 cryptographic hash function, broadly used trusted. hash value SHA-1, hash function returns 160-bit string. message digest. value hashed sent message; receipt point, value hashed again, two hash values compared. two hash values match, secure, reliable indication message hasn't changed; message receipt point accurate duplication message send point. you're using Shared Secret security mechanism, concatenate nonce, timestamp, Shared Secret, hash combined value using SHA-1. encode result, send message header value atmosphere_secret_digest parameter. formula computing hash Below example hashed base string: concatenate nonce, timestamp, app secret base string hashed, you'll need make sure concatenated value byte value before hashing. hashing algorithm requires input parameter bytes. Depending app, might need use encoding byte value. use UTF-8 encoding. Below example using Java. Note: example above part larger Java sample specific API. more information, refer implementation examples API you're using. Base64 encoding scheme converts binary data ASCII string. you're using Shared Secret security mechanism, must encode binary hash value created using SHA-1 secure hash algorithm. Encoding turns ASCII string format. It's common practice encode data make sure remains intact without modification during transport HTTPS. Once hash encoded, next step send encoded value message header value atmosphere_secret_digest parameter. there's problem HTTPS header, might error messages shown below. any reason know suspect app's Shared Secret might compromised, must generate new Shared Secret replace old generate new Shared Secret Community Platform Note: might take five minutes new key take effect.

You'll need public/private key pair upload public key Community Platform, explained later document. custom app code sign API requests using private key. API verifies each incoming request using public key. More information authenticating PKI given sections: process flow diagram below shows overview API request authentication PKI. use OpenSSL open source product produce public/private key pair. more information OpenSSL, refer www.openssl.org. developing application using Microsoft Windows adaptation OpenSSL Windows platform following location: http://code.google.com/p/openssl-for-windows/downloads/list. keypair certificate generation process includes files shown below.

Below example might command-line window. process creates public/private key pair certificate signing request (csr.csr file) c:\\openssl folder. Below example might command-line window. Note: Anything empty bracket set not required. Java developer worked cryptography Java, might familiar concept keystore. keystore file used store deploy certificates private keys single package. create keystore using OpenSSL explained above. However, Java developer, probably far more convenient use keytool, key certificate management utility that's distributed part Java Development Kit (JDK). use keytool create both keystore CSR associated private key keystore. Once you've created CSR, upload Community Platform just any CSR. Java code reads private key, used signing base string used API request headers, keystore file create. Since keytool utility part JDK, don't download anything create Java keystore. Just follow steps below.

Note: implementation examples, check authentication documentation specific API you're using. IMPORTANT: Upload file CSR.csr Community Platform portal. signature process follows similar approach OAuth standard. platform uses Extension header support its app authentication scheme. Extension header named Atmosphere (not case-sensitive). uses standard Authorization header WWW-Authenticate response header pass app-related authentication parameters. query string used pass authentication data cases app cannot directly manipulate headers. API providers indicate support extension returning Atmosphere WWW-Authenticate header response app requests protected resources.

API best designed built? goals must achieved order organization confirm built API according best practices? Understand clearly articulate detailed requirements API. Make sure agreement between key players before development starts. Separate functional non-functional requirements develop functional requirements. Iterate through API development process. Utilize existing SOA investment. Defining API Requirements Defining API does separated API does point, defining functional characteristics API, specifying interface, developing model use cases user stories. Implementation details purposely deferred until later. several artifacts help refine requirements. include: Use case models show relationship between actors use cases. Use cases describe scenario--the interaction between API user--as expected result. User stories small narrative descriptions describe specific interaction between API user system. soa.com Not every requirement need described detail, team might choose slightly modify artifacts use define requirement. However, set described provides best practices approach elaborating requirement. might find choose approach. right organization really depends organizational culture. Use Cases Use Case Models tend more prescriptive detailed, whereas User Stories more compact lend themselves better iterative approach. Whatever method methods choose, important thing explain requirements clearly, sufficient detail, API design development proceed smoothly successful completion. Use case models, use cases, user stories help illustrate requirements very practical realistic way, invaluable helping keep project focused real-world user needs. Identify API Used way API used affects several issues such technology choices, regulatory issues, security. example, API that's being used perform financial transactions more constraints delivering advertisements. ways API might used include: mobile application Delivery banner ads Web page part mashup Servicing financial transactions Providing self-serve portal Enabling connection new business existing enterprise soa.com API Usage Patterns users API help determine technology issues may determine content each development phase API being delivered. Consumers API include: Internal consumers External unregistered users External registered users Business partners general best plan least controlled set users identifying API function content. example, API intended internal users, chance future API made available business partners customers, designers focus external users determining API function content. may good idea develop API initially internal consumption before making available externally, design not factor external requirements future releases. Internal deployment may help identify new requirements added list possible features future development phases. allows API provider gain experience design before making public. important API provided external users, signals long-term commitment API, implies API stable. Regulatory Issues Almost any business activity affected form regulatory activity. business decides provide API consumers, probably requirement type regulatory compliance. activity business domain expert must identify applicable guidelines make sure included requirements list first release. usually easier product owner plan types issues earlier development phases retrofit requirement. Examples regulations might affect API development USA include PCI DSS payment card data security standard, HIPAA governs privacy healthcare information, FERPA Family Education Rights Privacy act). many others USA, each country its unique regulations. Key factors consider industry API deployed deployment areas. soa.com Usage, Content Functionality Constraints Not enterprises happy \"showing family jewels\" part API successful, must offer value those use must seen valuable, core part enterprise offering not likely case senior management unhappy risk being created exposure content functionality worried undesirable use API. It's important think through, discuss, agreement constrained API, phasing relaxing those constraints any). soa.com Leveraging SOA Investment organization through expense, trials, effort creating successful SOA infrastructure, makes sense leverage investment. design constraints modern API similar not identical those Services SOA. Design API different short cuts. However, organization successful SOA build API becomes largely exercise mapping rather fully blown coding. Separating Functional Non-Functional Requirements Not requirements functional nature: availability, scalability, logging, security, performance critical successful use API, none anything business process domain API's resource. information gathered during phase may understood before project begins. However, documenting non-functional requirements might identify new requirements not originally considered must added project backlog. affect cost viability project. Lastly, most Services SOA rendered non-reusable non-functional incompatibilities. certainly true APIs. example, fact particular security mechanism assumed hard-coded service, consumers required different security mechanism, means service/API not reusable. true any non-functional capability, including logging fail-over. two big differences between functional non-functional requirements: Non-functional requirements more variable functional requirements. Implementing non-functional requirements declarative policies quicker easier implementing functional requirements. differences between it's important separate two types requirements. soa.com Defining API Specification Once you've worked through points chapter, strategic groundwork done. Once you've identified mapped business strategy APIs, really API requirements, it's time put together API Specification. specification adds detail needed sensibly understand API intended its importance respect business strategy. Designing API APIs lightweight, self-describing, agile interfaces lend themselves easy access re-use. not SOA Services another name. must keep mind designing building APIs. being said, process designing developing APIs comparable required any software development projects, although notable differences spelled remainder section. Guidelines Apply Build Stages remainder chapter set sections collectively define steps follow designing building API. Throughout sections, keep mind following guidelines: Begin short section already defined specification covers functionality built, bearing mind stay flexible API definition, means omitting detail. Code API become more confident moving right direction. realistic: can't please every stakeholder. Many API designs suffer excessive constraints. definitely make mistakes. real world reveal able correct API evolve. soa.com Develop Simple API Structure Define object model. major differences between API design SOA Service design API's Data, Object Oriented, while SOA Services tended Process Oriented. Objects map resources, resource first class citizen protocol. Therefore, before anything else must object model defined API. stated Section already successfully running SOA Object model most likely already exists. Determine resource relationships based object model represent relationships resource. While relationship definitions consequence good modeling being stated resource definition must include explicit definition relationships ensure resource returned, result API request, relationships returned. greatly enhances support HATEOAS later definition). Build API Serve resources collections stubbed code started. help unit tests allow parallel development. API supporting Web client, stubbed backend greatly speed development. Conversely, composing aggregate API using composition tool mashup engine create operation time. Write API frequently, starting early process. API not complete, start programming learning process save time later avoid unnecessary implementation issues. applies either approach, both custom code mashup. Include resource relationships support HATEOAS. HATEOAS stands \"Hypermedia Engine Application State\". referring same \"state\" Representational State Transfer (REST). short HATEOAS means resource representation returned results API request representation not includes information defines resource, contains valid relationships resource resources state, valid states resource transition words resource self-describing. Determine strategy retrieving updating partial data. per statement made very start chapter, API's lightweight. soa.com need latency introduced fact live Internet. not often sensible return every resource meets requirements API request. API must designed consistent scheme allow App request partial set satisfying resources. Consequently, modification result set needs supported proper adherence HATEOAS resolve requirement. Add validation. Once following steps implemented successfully (remember partially per resource per general guidelines) Validation any resource subject PUT, POST, DELETE call (Usually JSON, may XML) developed. Use error code define transfer exception information. enable handle those exceptions client side. Build Client Keep simple. Use technology most familiar supports API technology set. tool such SOAPUI. client become invaluable both development testing. Make sure automated testing. important point. Once automatable incorporated API build test process. ensure consistent delivery new versions API. Add Non-functional Requirements Mime type Security authentication authorization Caching Paging Load balancing Fail-over Disaster Recovery Logging/Auditing list above good representation likely non-functional requirements met API, although list not exhaustive. Please aware not meant code solution requirements. stated section quite opposite suggested. good API Platform available organization supply components soa.com support solutions declaratively. important. Maximized re-use flexibility achieved non-functional requirements supported mechanism. being said, adding support non-functional requirements late stage does not imply less important steps mentioned. It's just more practical ensure required functionality supported before adding requisite complications non-functional support. Apart security, two broad types non-functional requirements list represents. first performance, second resilience. Both types solved combination Network Architecture API Platform.

Authorization Authentication table below shows common authorization authentication options APIs. Authorization Authentication options API keys (Yahoo Google Maps APIs) Fairly open, API key gives API provider way know identity each caller. API provider use information maintain log establish quotas user. Usernames passwords /OAuth (Twitter) Session-based authentication OAuth OAuth designed solve application-to-application security problems. technology allows user give API site access account another site, whole importantly, part, without sharing password. Instead sharing password, user logs grant access; OAuth \"token\" provides continuing access requesting app. additional benefit user revoke OAuth access any time. Two-Way SSL, SAML, WS-Security... API primarily used \"enterprise\" customers. Provide greater security; used more sensitive data, technologies work application-to-application communications. more complex associated API. Comparisons soa.com API security, recommend OAuth, new improved authentication authorization standard. OAuth takes lessons learned XACML SAML SOA world applies problem exists current crop Web Security practices. current security solutions assume two actors, consumer provider. traditional client-server authentication model, client uses its credentials access its resources hosted server. OAuth introduces third role model: resource owner. OAuth model, client not resource owner, acting its behalf) requests access resources controlled resource owner, hosted server. order client access resources, first obtain permission resource owner. permission expressed form token matching shared secret. purpose token make unnecessary resource owner share its credentials client. Unlike resource owner credentials, tokens issued restricted scope limited lifetime revoked independently. Why important? unlike Web's traditional two-party, client-server model, API extract more value mashups APIs third party such mobile App. problem order applications access user data sites, ask usernames passwords. Not does require exposing user passwords someone else often same passwords used online banking sites provides applications unlimited access. anything, including changing passwords locking users OAuth provides method users grant third-party access resources without sharing passwords. provides way grant limited access scope, duration, etc.). example, Facebook user give another app access, via OAuth, contacts list without allowing app create posts. three OAuth versions; newly released most common implementation fixed security vulnerability OAuth although being newly released having simpler handshaking protocol better support JavaScript, may become more common version implemented short period time. looking platform implements OAuth support API's make sure supports least delivery date support soa.com Protecting Data Detecting Threats APIs use Web technologies open Internet, API developer encounter security threats commonplace ecosystem. Security non-trivial issue APIs, especially considering expose internal systems unknown outsider users. Consider following API security risks, determine steps might need take threat prevention, detection, handling: Malicious Code Injection manipulates security design flaws technologies send valid code services using SQL, LDAP, XPATH, XQuery statements open interface any user take control cause harm. Denial Service (DoS) Attacks -cripples API overwhelming requests \"Request Burst\"). Service Information LeakageAn API inadvertently leaking data its configuration, resulting ability take control expose private data. Broken Session IDs, Keys Authentication- Exposure unauthorized access through authentication factors not functioning poor security design technology bugs. API Data Eavesdropping non-secure API communications expose data access while transit. Tampering API Requests Responses- attack manipulates API request response parameters exchanged between client services goal modification data. Example \"Man Middle\" type attacks. Manage API Quality Service (QoS) OAuth enables enterprise resolve use API. However, many times use Excessive API use more damaging costly API provider use another side discussion. Good, well-built designed APIs monetized. monetization not countenanced management, nor accepted API users, unless SLA agreements managed, automatically, API. best way easily definable, modifiable, actionable QoS policies based reliable metrics. soa.com First, look API provider. API interface, door organization's business, defined allowed organization. representative any organization allowed implement critical business system without ability monitor control critical factors such accessing usage levels, performance. Therefore, doesn't make sense implement API, exposes critical business capability Internet, without similar controls place. Conversely, API consumer not likely use API don't guarantee availability performance API, since interruptions service adversely affect consumer's ability deliver its own business services, whether monetary technical. best practice addressing issues define manage service level agreements (SLAs) through contracts standards-based declarative. agreements place, API manager define absolute performance availability constraints API, specify such alerts issued constraints violated. Over-use treated throttling, while under-capacity treated dynamic provisioning additional capacity needed. Thus, organization its department assured API not perform any worse expected, not consume any resource expected. API consumer guaranteed availability performance requires, whether paying guarantee not, addition, consumer guarantees not require, use, anything more established. Please note any guarantee leads SLAs Quota policies must backed legally enforceable agreements between consumer entity enterprise, otherwise just defining policies monitoring purposes process defining contract between App API summarized follows: Determine absolute maximum capabilities API (max supportable throughput, response time, availability, etc.) Define SLA policy API warns criteria, alerts between depending criteria. soa.com Analyze SOA Services support API systems, not SOA infrastructure) apply SLA policies services match SLAs defined API. Determine capabilities required App codify SLA policy App, warnings alerts agreed. Define quota policies cease allowing access API, based alert levels SLA policy defined step Define contract specifies identity consumer API includes app SLA quota policies defined steps summary, contract defines app access API, constraints (specified Plan). API owner know API additional resources allocated load balancing load sharing strategies defined limits its SLA policy exceeded. It's worth paying particular attention step above process. most enterprises, implementation API not likely reside code supporting App Server. Rather services already exist organization's SOA backend systems organization not yet created its SOA). case, defining SLA policies managing services using critical managing API itself, reason fact something causing SLA transgression next step root-cause analysis services supporting API anyway. Having process place, utilizes Plans Contracts, allows simpler consideration charging App owner based agreed Plan. Monitoring API Usage not possible implement ability manage API's quality service (QoS) without ability monitor activities usage API. API management solution enable monitor performance availability API its consumers. best practice monitor aspects usage API, such most popular consumers, most popular operation, operation consumption per consumer. Analytics running API very useful planning extensions API, understanding actual popularity money making ability API comparison projected. soa.com Furthermore, API involved financial transactions, might required make API metrics part audit process. Law compliance policies require adhere specific security practices. responses enable detection unauthorized users. Lastly, root cause analysis heavily relies logging means providing window actions API time error. Without deep, easily variable, logging capability, API issue resolution become horribly hitand-miss activity. API monitoring must meet needs three key roles: App Developer/provider API Developer API Operations staff First, App developer need ability requests responses API look treated API. ability able gauge app's impact API via common usage performance metrics. not same formalized SLAs mentioned previous section, metrics help determine SLA conformance. Second, API developer need logging help debug code while building API, need able metrics API performance during stress testing. Lastly, once API production, operations personnel need logging help root cause analysis any usage issues might arise, need monitor metrics app usage API's performance relation app. instance, might need provide auditors verifiable logs API requests soa.com Sharing API Once you've put hard work investment resources creation production API, equally hard work sharing popularizing begins. Supporting App developer community critical factor successful adoption API. App developers drawn API obvious being supported API provider colleagues. Without vibrant satisfied developer community, API unlikely used wide audience. Ensuring profitable engagement developers involves such considerations interactive forums, excellent documentation, ability test against API, Software Development Kit (SDK) makes easier deliver API external developers. best practices supporting API once it's released: Interact recognize API Developers. Create SDKs make life easier API Developers. Create great documentation API use Make testing against API easy possible. Monetize API assist future cost benefit analysis. Interact Recognize Developers Developers typically communicate developers. App Developers particular may work geographically dispersed teams still share thoughts ideas. API provider provide environment makes easy. API management tool include following features help give developers information interaction need: FAQ: frequently asked question section easily quickly solve many questions new developer good FAQ expected greatly enhance initial developer experience. Blogs: Provide blog chief technical designers discuss options, opinions, possible enhancements API. Developers know API may evolving. several good examples soa.com used model. example, good place share implementation tips, information upcoming releases. issues API, developers appreciate being notified pitfalls ideally, workarounds. Forums: perhaps most valuable communication tools available. allows developers share problems, solutions, suggestions each forums constantly monitored API provider proper content, most cases API provider not major participant. medium developers. Access API developers: Providing way key external developers communicate directly API development team very effective. needs controlled prevent overloading internal team; however, providing e-mail address appropriate privacy measure implemented, course) external developers ask specific questions make suggestions another way foster community developers. developers likely thrive efforts recognized. best champion API happy, informed knowledgeable developer constantly using community help App Developers. ways recognize developers include: Monetary: Establish monetary incentives higher levels adoption usage API. Peer Recognition: Establish superstar criteria feature outstanding developers shown new innovative ways use API. Peer recognition developer community strong incentive. Involvement API design strategy: developer invited help work through future API, bring unique insight API owner. developer reverently treated App Developer community, more powerful advocate use API. soa.com Create SDKs Making easy possible App developers use API may necessitate creation software development kit (SDK).For instance, platforms/devices support OAuth REST JSON not simple others. Consider following reasons might build SDK: Speed adoption specific platform example, Objective-C SDK iPhone. Lots experienced developers just starting Objective-C, SDK might helpful. Simplify integration effort required work API key use cases complex need complemented standard on-client processing. Reduce bad inefficient code might slow down service everyone. Create developer resource Good SDKs help users write good code providing good source code examples. Market API specific community upload SDK samples plug-in page platform's existing developer community. Foster adoption across devices--you might produce APIs currently popular platforms; providing corresponding SDKs each device help encourage developers across boards use API. said, may not provide SDK. example, API designed adoption, well-documented built using standards-based approach, developers may able rolling without client SDK. Below reasons might decide against providing SDK: Resources it's tough provide SDK each platform target. You'll choose carefully. time-consuming expensive create SDKs. (Tip: Packaging internal samples test cycles provide good starting point SDK development.) Maintenance versioning convincing clients upgrade newest version rough. capturing \"local flavor\" each language support challenge. Complexity each platform might use cases don't expect, such keeping application-level secrets clients, debugging, forth. soa.com More not necessarily better few well-documented code-level samples often best resource. Facebook provides Android, iPhone, JavaScript, PHP, Python libraries documented differently), Twitter supplies none. Facebook more resources still difficult, times, understand use Facebook APIs. worth acknowledging delivering SDKs big job building API. discussed earlier, job not done just building API. \"Field Dreams\" API economy, building API half job. Getting App developers excited API telling others great documentation SDKs ultimately make fantastic API successful. Document API You're need well-written documentation successful sharing API. Though live interaction may better way communication, there's just substitute non-ambiguous documentation explaining complex critical notions.
